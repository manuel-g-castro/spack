package.py is made of that in v0.15.4 and the current
master branch of spack git.

* Summary of major changes
1. Version list is updated, adding from 20201029 (stable version)
to 20200602. For 20200630, a patch file is prepared to avoid an 
error in linling (CMAKE_TUNE_DEFAULT in Clang).
It seems to be an issue on CMake, but I'm not sure..
2. New variant, mliap, is added. This variant is available from
20200630 (See depend_on).
3. Use fftw-api, instead of directly setting fftw. 
4. Dependencies of latte and kokkos are modified.
5. Add a setting of using BLAS and LAPACK for user-atc and 
latte variants. 

* TODO
+ To check kokkos with OpenMP and Atomic operation 
support.

+ To check build with two kinds of variants, 
latte and voronoi.

+ To add a specific archtecture setting of kokkos
if that for A64FX is released. (I'm not sure when ...)

+ To tread KIM of the standard package of LAMMPS. This is 
because package.py for kim-api has been already available.

+ Calculations with USER-ATC seems to be unstable
in A64FX with FJ compiler, but I have not yet fully 
resolved the origin.

package.py is made of that in v0.15.4.

YO replaces 'as-is' package.py with RIST version.
The original package.py (v0.15.1) is in save/.
Other files (*.patch and Makefile.inc) are the same
as the original ones.

* Summary of major changes
1. When detecting Fujitsu compiler (i.e., %fj), a proper compiler 
optimization flag is automatically set.
Note that you can recover the original compiler flag, 
which is automatically set by CMake, if build_type=MinSizeRel.

2. A description on 'openmp' variant is added, to suggest  
that users choose +user-omp or +kokkos (or BOTH) whenever 
setting +openmp.

3. Two new variants are added.
   gzip:     To use gzip support
   lmpsizes: To select integer type
Note that +user-atc is NOT compatible for lmpsizes=bigbig.
I add a conflict setting to package.py.

4. Dependency checking on gzip, kokkos with OpenMP, 
and zlib is added.

* TODO
+ To check kokkos with OpenMP and Atomic operation 
support.

+ To check build with two kinds of variants, 
latte and voronoi.

+ To add a specific archtecture setting of kokkos
if that for A64FX is released. (I'm not sure when ...)

+ To check usage of BLAS/LAPACK (and ScaLAPACK) via
Fujitsu SSL2. Note that the relevant variatns are 
latte and user-atc.
